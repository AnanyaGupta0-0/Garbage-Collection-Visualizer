# Garbage-Collection-Visualizer
## 📌 Project Overview
The Garbage Collection Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to illustrate how memory management and garbage collection work in programming languages. This project provides a visual representation of memory allocation, object references, and garbage collection processes.

## 🎯 Features
- **Live Memory Visualization**: Watch how objects are allocated and deallocated in real time.  
- **Multiple GC Algorithms**: Supports visualization of different garbage collection techniques like Mark-Sweep, Reference Counting, and Generational GC.  
- **Custom Object Allocation**: Users can create and delete objects dynamically to see how the GC reacts.  
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Allows pausing and stepping through the garbage collection process.  
- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface with detailed explanations.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js/D3.js for visualization)
- **Algorithms: Mark-Sweep, Reference Counting, Generational GC

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Garbage-Collection-Visualizer
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Object Creation:** Create objects and assign references in the simulation.  
2. **Garbage Generation:** Break references to generate garbage data.  
3. **Garbage Collection:** Watch the visual representation of different GC techniques.  
4. **Analyze Memory:** See which objects survive and how memory is freed.

- 🔹 Improved UI with animations  
- 🔹 Performance analysis tools  
- 🔹 Export and save simulation states
